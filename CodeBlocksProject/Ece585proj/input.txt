Page empty: ACT + Rd + burst = 24 + 24 + 4 = 52*2 = 104 clocks

Do incremental development
maintain state for every bank and bank group (ie is it open
or closed?, if open what row is it open to?, keep track of the 
number of clock ticks since the last command of each command type that has
been issued to that bank or bank group. for each bank or bank group, youd 
have time since last command)
Just worry about the head of the queue for now, then add a loop for up to
16 things in the queue
After this you can start optimizing
